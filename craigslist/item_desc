CHECK THIS SERIAL: C02Q5ZRUG8WN    Suspect:  Korean guy  Skinny face, skinny body, 5'9 5'10  Short hair  Drives a newer black prius  Probably in and around Koreatown or korean communities.    Check your Macbook before you buy. If it matches, you have  registered stolen goods and in direct harms way, and probably put unintentionally in an investigation that is moving fast.I dont want innocent people to be involved, or possibly hurt. The device is already flagged by serial number.    Dude jacked me in broad daylight, He is a dangerous guy, so call the police if you get in contact with him or maybe see him. He might be around koreatown. But otherwise, he should be caught relatively quickly. All I can say is that he didn't plan this well and left everything the cops need. Just wanna warn you guys about him, he might sell it or he might try to jack you. Be careful out there and please call the police if come in contact with him. Police are already looking for him.

I don't have it set up to test it, just pulled it out of storage, plugged it in (lights up) so should be still working.  Does NOT come with adapter, box, manual, etc.        1) SpeedStream 5360 Ethernet DSL Modem by EFFICIENT NETWORK  Speedstream 5360 DSL Modem, Factory Refurbished with 90 day warranty. These modems look like they're new in the box.

I don't have it set up to test it, just pulled it out of storage, plugged it in (lights up) so should be still working.  Does NOT come with adapter, box, manual, etc.          Brand Name: D-Link      Model: DI-704      Hardware Platform: CONSUMER_ELECTRONICS      Number of Ports: 4    NAT and IP sharing for up to 32 users  Easy Web-based management  DHCP server    Designed for home or small-business PCs, the D-Link DI-704 is a broadband gateway with four switched Fast Ethernet ports that delivers complete hardware firewall protection for a PC. Allowing multiple computers to share one IP address to access the Internet via a cable or DSL modem, the DI-704 provides four 10/100 dual-speed Ethernet ports and one 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port for a cable or DSL modem or other broadband access device. The DI-704 can support up to 32 computers with firewall protection using the same ISP through its Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) that provides dynamic allocation of IP addresses.    Installing the system is easy: simply plug the DI-704 into your DSL or cable modem, then plug your computer's Ethernet cable into the DI-704.    The DI-704 acts as a natural firewall to protect your computer from intruders. Once your computer is set up to access the Internet through the DI-704, your network is invisible behind the DI-704. However, because some games and Internet applications work only with direct computer interaction, you can open specific ports to operate without the protection of the firewall to ensure that these applications will run properly.    Advanced options, including NAT firewall protection, DMZ host, setting the IP range and domain name for DHCP, and changing access rights for different computers, can be set up via your Web browser. Compliant with IEEE 802.3 standards, the DI-704 works with any Ethernet device and multiple types of machines and operating systems.

         hello craig.      I own an online store on Amazon, i have about 2,000 books in AMAZON inventory all kinds of genres, and 90% new.       I am heading a different direction, and can't take care of it anymore.        I'm asking $5000 for the 2000 books, and I can provide an inventory sheet of the 1000+ books to save you LOTS of time from uploading 1000 items, the other 1000 you'll have to upload.      THIS IS A GOOD KICK START IF YOU PLAN ON STARTING SELLING ON AMAZON.      THIS IS JUST THE INVENTORY, BUT IF YOU WISH TO BUY THE ACCOUNT, I CAN DO THAT TOO, WE HAVE 100% FEEDBACK PRO ACCOUNT AND ABOUT 5 FEEDBACKS.      IF INTERESTED EMAIL ME OR TEXT   show contact info         only serious buyers, if you're interested i can send you pictures of some of the book titles so you can see what kind of books they are. pricing varies per book on amazon is from $3-$400 per books.    I am not selling my Amazon account just the inventory! this is a chance for you to start an online business but with a huge kickstart.Everything has it's own sku and already organized in it's own bin. This makes finding the book SUPER EASY!       I can also tell you where you can buy the books from to continue your business.        If interested please contact me via email only.      Thank you!

          BLACK LIGHT KIT WITH   FRONT PANEL ON-OFF-ON SWITCH   IDEAL FOR      SHOWING OFF THE INSIDE OF YOUR LAN PARTY RIG   "Wow! Very cool lighting effects!"   Click on "more ads by this user" over to the right on this page. Buy more than 1 item from me and knock $5.00 off the cost of each  additional item!    For sale here is a custom lighting kit for the inside of your computer, typically for computers with windows in their case. For your convenience (and an extra $11.00) I can ship this item to you via USPS Priority Mail, arriving in 2-3 days, sometimes sooner. Overnight locally. Please contact Mitch @   show contact info     I put this kit together for one of my fancy computers. The kit for sale here consists of:  2 - 12" long Black Light tubes, both connected to the same power supply. A Custom Switch Unit.    The Custom Switch Unit consists of a heavy-duty, 3 position toggle switch mounted on a drive bay filler panel, with the typical computer power supply connectors on it.. The switch plugs into your computer power supply. In my computer I had it operating 2 different sets of lights.   In one position the switch would turn on the Black Lights. In an otherwise dark case the black lights would really emphasize certain items like the green flexo sleeving that is on the black light power unit cable. In the other position the switch would turn on a brighter, colored light. In the center position of the switch all lights are off. Switching from one set of the lights to the other provides quite a dramatic effect.

NOTE: DI-704 only - NO adapter plug, manual or box, etc.  SpeedStream DSL Modem has adapter (NO manual, box, etc.)    I had both in storage (as I switched cable providers a while back and don't use this set up anymore) and is SOLD AS IS.  I don't have it set up to test it, just pulled it out of storage, plugged it in (lights up) so should be still working.  Does NOT come with adapter, box, manual, etc.        1) SpeedStream 5360 Ethernet DSL Modem by EFFICIENT NETWORK  Speedstream 5360 DSL Modem, Factory Refurbished with 90 day warranty. These modems look like they're new in the box.    Compatible with all Network Layer protocols, including IP and IPX  LEDs indicate device status and network activity  Standard RJ-45 10Base-T Ethernet connector  RJ-45 ADSL network connector    Features:  - Works with PCs, laptops, and workstations that have a standard 10Base-T Ethernet port  - Provides high-speed access for all computers on a Local Area Network  - Includes an easy-to-read installation guide  - Up to 8Mbps download for high-speed Internet access  - Supports multiple Ethernet-attached devices         2) D-Link DI-704 Internet Gateway and Firewall with 4 Port Switch  by D-Link    NOTE: DI-704 only - NO adapter plug or box, etc.  I had this in storage (as I switched cable providers a while back and don't use this set up anymore - also selling an external modem) and is SOLD AS IS.  I don't have it set up to test it, just pulled it out of storage, plugged it in (lights up) so should be still working.  Does NOT come with adapter, box, manual, etc.          Brand Name: D-Link      Model: DI-704      Hardware Platform: CONSUMER_ELECTRONICS      Number of Ports: 4    NAT and IP sharing for up to 32 users  Easy Web-based management  DHCP server    Designed for home or small-business PCs, the D-Link DI-704 is a broadband gateway with four switched Fast Ethernet ports that delivers complete hardware firewall protection for a PC. Allowing multiple computers to share one IP address to access the Internet via a cable or DSL modem, the DI-704 provides four 10/100 dual-speed Ethernet ports and one 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port for a cable or DSL modem or other broadband access device. The DI-704 can support up to 32 computers with firewall protection using the same ISP through its Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) that provides dynamic allocation of IP addresses.    Installing the system is easy: simply plug the DI-704 into your DSL or cable modem, then plug your computer's Ethernet cable into the DI-704.    The DI-704 acts as a natural firewall to protect your computer from intruders. Once your computer is set up to access the Internet through the DI-704, your network is invisible behind the DI-704. However, because some games and Internet applications work only with direct computer interaction, you can open specific ports to operate without the protection of the firewall to ensure that these applications will run properly.    Advanced options, including NAT firewall protection, DMZ host, setting the IP range and domain name for DHCP, and changing access rights for different computers, can be set up via your Web browser. Compliant with IEEE 802.3 standards, the DI-704 works with any Ethernet device and multiple types of machines and operating systems.

In 802.11b, the data can be transmitted at a rate of 11, 5.5, 2, or 1 Mbps. As the distance between an adapter and access point increases or decreases, the data rate automatically changes. Other factors, like interference, also affect the data rate. The Dell Wireless 2350 Broadband Router uses automatic rate selection and rate scaling to determine the most efficient rate of communication. Rate scaling maintains optimal communication between wireless clients and the Dell Wireless 2350 Broadband Router.

         A canon printer that was a hand down. Still functions great, it just has some superficial wear on the body. Loaded with lots of features and quality printing. I only have the A/C cord so you'll need a standard printer cable to connect to your CPU.      Check out the specs here:    http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_ip_series/pixma_ip6700d#Features.    They still sell for $150 to $200 new. 5 of the 6 ink cartridges are low so hence the price I'm asking as well. Good starter printer if you're on a budget.    Please email me if you're interested or you have a question. Thanks.              Wireless, Photo Quality, Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Wifi, Sharp, Fast, Lab...

         PLEASE READ ENTIRE POST!  This listing is for the HP Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (service pack 1). Brand new, sealed, never used.    For $15 you get JUST the disc - either the 64-bit or 32 bit version discs. Pick the one you need for your hardware/system (make sure your computer can handle the 64bit, if that is what you think you need. It can slow down an older computer, in which case, I recommend 32bit). NO COA/Product key included so make sure you have a working one for your system!)    For $50 you get the disc (either 32 or 64 bit) AND the new Product key/COA/activation code. Use these to install a fresh operating system on your computer. Also this can upgrade you to Windows 7, from XP or Vista.    For $125-150 (depending on the length of time required) you get the disc (either 32 or 64 bit) AND the new Product key/COA/activation code AND I will install it all for you. I am an IT professional, working full time for major corporations for the past 5 years.    I have a few of these, if you need more than one. These are authentic discs, not copied software or a generic utility disc.    These discs and keys came from a large company upgrade/project where we upgraded user to new systems, but we used the company's Microsoft windows 7 image and multiuser key, therefore these windows discs and keys were not used.    Tested this on HP, Dell, and Sony systems and worked fine, but I cannot guarantee on all systems, however it should work well if you know what to do.

         This is a used set of computer speakers. It's a 5.1 setup and while a bit old has been cared for. Everything works but I have lost one of the legs for the two tripods that come with the system.     (If you don't use the tripods this isn't a big deal. If you do, I'm sure you can jury rig something up to replace the missing leg.)    The thing that is unique about this system is it comes with its own built in Dolby Digital receiver.

         Late 2008/Early 2009 Macbook Pro 15 inch, comes with original Apple charger, 4gb of ram and a 60gb hard drive. Physically in overall good condition with no major scratches or dents except left bottom corner of the screen sligtly bent (see pictures). Had video until yesterday when someone tried troubleshooting WiFi (which doesn't work) and apparently broke the video cable. Keyboard was also working perfectly, and a fresh copy of OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 was installed just prior to this fiasco. The LCD itself is intact, and should work (no guarantees though, this is a broken computer for all purposes). One thing worth mentioning is it takes a few seconds and sometimes a wiggle for the charger to get the light on, after which, it seems to start and makes the chime sound, but without video, it's hard to tell whether the OS loads or not. I don't have the proper tools or adapters to check with an external monitor.    TEXT only 661-4o2-one2-one5

         Sonar X3 Producer from Cakewalk is music production software that contains all the recording, editing and mastering features needed to deliver a variety of professional audio and video related products. The software features unlimited simultaneous audio and MIDI tracks, FX, sends and busses, and full VST3 support using a 64-bit mix engine. The ProChannel console strip employs a console emulator and tape emulator to deliver authentic vintage analog sound.    The comping feature allows for recording any number of takes and then selecting the best parts from each, providing a quick way to get a flawless performance. VST3 support is now fully integrated, and the software automatically detects new VST plug-ins without the need to rescan. For pitch correction, time stretching, and audio to MIDI conversion, Melodyne Essential is included, and ARA (Audio Random Access) integration means no more waiting for data to transfer into the editor - simply click to open the audio clip and get to work.    The Matrix View allows for organizing audio and MIDI loops, phrases, and one shots into cells and columns for real-time triggering from one (or more) MIDI controllers. Use it to easily arrange song sections, or for complex sets of multiple grooves, one-shots, drops, and breakdowns - all playable in real-time. Additional enhancements include access to an organized collection of loops, one-shots, effects and instruments via a searchable browser, which can then be incorporated into projects with a simple drag and drop.     A full version of Addictive Drums 2 is included, bringing the world of premium drum kits and percussion to the computer. Highlights include many new Sound Shaping features (Transient Shaper, Tone Designer, more Kitpiece slots, Delerb processor, and more) , all new Beat Creation Tools (Beat Transformer, Grid Search, Beats Browser, direct MIDI recording, and much more) and upgraded ADpaks and MIDIpaks that make full use of AD2.

         Cubix Xpander Desktop Elite 1500W Gen2 GPU Expansion System         The Cubix Xpander Desktop Elite is a portable PCI Express (PCIe) expansion enclosure that enables connection   of graphics processing units (GPUs) or other controllers to a host computer.   The host must have one PCIe x16 expansion slot available for the host interface controller (HIC).   Desktop Elite provides four PCIe Gen 2 x16 slots on one main interface board (MIB) for double-wide GPUs that are   NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) -enabled. Desktop Elite supports other PCIe adapters as well.   Xpander supports applications that exploit multiple GPUs, including rendering graphics or high-performance computing (HPC).    Add 4 single-slot or dual-slot PCIe cards in you host PC or Mac Pro using GPU-Xpander Desktop Elite.   Connecting Desktop Elite to your Apple Mac Pro (2008-2012 models),   Linux or Microsoft Windows 7 / 8 host computers provide your desktop operators with the ability to support up to   four dual-slot GPUs, graphics cards or other PCIe cards such as Red Rocket, Blackmagic Design Decklink, Bluefish 444, NVIDIA SDI Capture or other cards.    Desktop Elite is an economical way to add GPUs or other PCIe cards to your host computers.   Installing the Cubix host interface controller (HIC) in an available PCIe Gen 2 / Gen 3 x16 slot within your   host computers assures your operators that they will enjoy a full 80Gbps (5Gbps x 16 lanes = 80Gbps)   transfer rate to and from the GPUs or other cards you install in GPU-Xpander Desktop Elite.    Add four NVIDIA Quadro 4000 / 5000 / 6000, GeForce GTX 580 / 680, Tesla C2050 / C2070 / C2075 graphics   or other controllers to any computer that has an available PCIe expansion slot using Xpander Desktop 4.   Install the HIC in the computer's PCIe x16 slot and connect it to Desktop 4 - you have just added   four dual-slot or four single-slot, CUDA-capable graphics or HPC controllers to your current PC or Mac Pro without buying a new computer.    Included  Xpander Desktop Elite XPDT-X16-ELDHE  Cooling fan  1,500W auto-ranging power supply  Power cord  Main Interface Board (MIB)  1x PCIe x16 HIC  2x external PCIe x16 cable, 3meter long and 1meter long

         This is a late 2012 Mac Mini with the maxed out 2.6 GHz Quad Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM and a 1 TB hard drive.  It has been, and to this day is, a beastly little computer and I've loved it since I first bought it from the Apple Store.  I am the one and only, original owner of the computer.  My reason for selling it is that I will be moving into a tiny house and a Macbook is more suitable for the new space.  It comes with the Apple brand blutooth keyboard as well.  The computer has been very well taken care of, is very clean and works wonderfully.  Check out the photos and let me know if you're interested.

         Hello,    I have a brand new Macbook Pro Retina Display 15inch still with warranty that expires at the end of next month so you still have an opportunity to extend it to the 3 year warranty.    I have installed the new 10.11 El Capitan Operating System which has cool new features. But if you'd like me to downgrade to 10.10 Yosemite I will.    The macbook is in perfect condition and was hardly ever used. It comes with a clear InCASE, The Original Box and all of its accessories.     This Macbook is Absolutely Clean, No scratches ANYWHERE! Always kept on desk.     This Macbook has the best specs you can ask for on a MacBook Pro.    2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 Turboboost up to 3.7 GhZ (Configureable to 2.8 GhZ)  16 GB 1600 MhZ DDR3 RAM  500gb of Flash Storage (Configureable to 1TB Flash storage)  Intel Iris Pro 1536MB    Warranty expires Oct 28th, 2015.     I used this macbook to edit videos on Adobe Premier and it was blazing fast. Even with a thunderbolt connected external HD and external SSD, it was incredibly fast. I was able to edit videos and photos in half the time it would normally take me.     I'm selling this Macbook because times are tough and I unfortunately I haven't been producing as much as before. Bought at $2300 selling it at $1700 - My loss, your gain!     I will include all of the following:  Box with all accessories  External DVD RW burner  And whatever programs you need on a flash drive. Aperture/FCP/Microsoft Office/Motion/iLife/Adobe Studio 6.0 - although I highly recommend purchasing the subscription for the new Adobe Creative Cloud. Totally worth it.

This concept has been realised in a variety of ways by different manufacturers, from full-blown recording/editing packages like Pro Tools and Sonic Solutions, to modular stand-alone recorders from companies like Akai, amongst others. Until recently, however, only Otari had made the commitment to a 24-track machine designed as a direct drop-in replacement for an analogue multitrack. The first RADAR (Random Access Digital Audio Recorder) appeared in 1994 and has built a keen following, becoming the recorder of choice for many studios, artists, composers, engineers and producers.  Having dominated the market for many years, Otari now have direct competition from Euphonix with their soon-to-be-released R1. However, Otari have moved the goal posts by introducing the new RADAR II, taking advantage of the latest technology combined with a wealth of experience gained from the original model. RADAR II now provides 24 tracks of 24-bit digital audio on a single hard drive, with simple editing facilities, the ability to be linked with other machines providing up to 192 sample-synchronised tracks, and remains capable of replaying original RADAR recordings.  Whilst instantly recognisable, the new RADAR II is radically different from its older sibling, both in appearance and internal technology. The original machine featured track meters, transport controls, an LCD screen and a floppy disk drive on the front of the main rackmounting unit itself, while the large ergonomic remote control panel -- one of the major strengths of the machine -- provided a host of dedicated transport and editing buttons plus a repeat of the LCD information screen. The machine's three hard disks (at the time, a drive could barely accommodate simultaneous record and replay of up to eight tracks), were fixed internal devices, although external drives could be appended to the SCSI buss.  That design has now evolved somewhat. The front of the main rack unit (which remains the same size as the earlier model) is rather plain in comparison. Otari found that no-one used the controls on the machine itself, as they all preferred to use the remote control, and by removing the meters, transport and track-arming buttons, sufficient space was gained to incorporate a single removable hard drive bay and an Exabyte tape drive for backing up and archiving recorded material (the floppy disk drive has been retained for software updates). Integrating the backup medium into the machine is a very positive step and helps to mitigate this time-consuming drawback of all hard disk recorders.  The remote controller looks much like the original, with the vast majority of buttons being in the same place and performing the same function. Indeed, the new panel can be used with original RADAR units if required, and RADAR power-users whose fingers fly around the controller in a blur will still be able to hit the right buttons in the right order! In fact the only obvious difference, to the casual observer, is that the track-arming buttons have been moved from an 8x3 group on the left hand side to a 2x24 group along the top edge (enabling direct 48-track working with a pair of linked machines).  The space vacated by the track-arming buttons has been used for a new 4x8 group of function buttons (of which 17 are currently unallocated) which provide direct access to various housekeeping functions including project and media management -- facilities which were previously only available through the screen menus.  Aside from this subtle but effective makeover to the remote, the other important change is the ability to attach a meterbridge to its rear edge. Currently, only a 24-track meter display is available, but since there are now 48 arming buttons on the controller I would not be surprised if Otari produced a 48-track version in the future.

         Hi, Im selling my late 2009 iMac 27". Here are some specs.     -includes wireless keyboard, magic mouse, and magic trackpad ($70)  -Upgraded to 250GB Samsung 840EVO SSD ($120)   -Additional 1,000GB HDD  -16GB RAM (pic says 12, but I upgraded that to 16)  -Perfect condition! no scratches, dents or dead pixels  -Has 2nd partition prepared on SSD for you to install Windows or Linux if you like.      This is a great personal computer to have. The SSD has TRIM enabled so its superrr fast when opening applications (web browser, iTunes, Photoshop, etc.) literally at the blink of an eye. No need to wait around for loading screens. It never lags or freezes anymore, which was the reason I installed the SSD and additional RAM in the first place. Unfortunately, to do this I had to remove the CD-ROM drive, but if you absolutely need the CD drive I will gladly reinstall it (you really wont miss it : ). It has the stock 1TB hard drive in addition to the 250GB SSD so you'll have plenty of storage for video or music editing. Its configured to boot from SSD and the 1TB HDD is primarily for storage of items that you don't use too often. Screen looks absolutely gorgeous and I really don't want to part ways with this iMac, but I need something that can run Solid Works (not supported on OSX). Feel free to txt or call. John.

         Selling my budget Gaming PC. It is a powerful machine that runs cool and quiet. It can handle pretty much any game out there. I've been using it to play Dota 2. It runs super smooth. It also can easily handle video rendering. You are more than welcome to test the system out before you buy it.

         Why is it still in the box? We bought it from Office Depot a long while ago and promptly took it out of the box, installed it and quickly discovered that this HP printer does everything, except, it wouldn't do it for us. Frustrated we gave up and resumed using our old faithful printer, placing this one back in its original box (with plans to take it back to Office Depot.) Time passed and it became too late to take it back. It did not work for us but it probably will work for someone who's not printer challenged as we are.   That is the sad story behind this HP PRINTER J4580 that does everything but not for us.    Are the cartridges in the printer? The cartridges that came with the printer were installed, and they still are in the printer.

         Perfect condition. 15" MacBook Pro with SuperDrive. Has been babied. Original box. Original power cords. I'm so anal about fingerprints on the screen that I never even close the lid without putting a piece of cloth between the keyboard and screen. Heck, even the little Apple window stickers are still with this bugger. It's performed like a champ ever since I got it. I'm literally only selling it in order to downsize a bit. I'm doing more traveling now and trying to make my kit lighter, so downsizing to a lighter smaller version.    2.6Ghz Intel Core i7  8GB RAM  250GB Solid State Flash HardDrive  Running OS X Yosemite    Comes loaded with the following software if you'd like or I can wipe the thing completely clean.

Don't miss out!        **The late-2009 iMac was initially manufactured with internal hard drives that were flawed, and would fail over time. Apple conducted a recall program allowing anyone with a late '09 iMac to have the hard drive replaced free of charge. This computer underwent that replacement program, and received a new 1TB hard drive in January of 2013. I have included a photo of that paperwork confirming hard drive replacement.    Please note: this computer does not include a keyboard or mouse

         Are you looking for a great headset for your PC/Laptop?  The headset still works like new. The pads have been replaced and never worn since.  Pick these up!    This Logtiech G35 headset is one of the best headsets on the market. From personal experience, the sound very clear, with deep pounding base. Once you put it on, it transports you into another dimension and immerse you into your game or movie. I really love this headset. They are so much better than turtle beaches, afterglow, creative sound, and razer headsets. I've demoed the others to make this opinion.     The headset still works like new.

         This is a less than one year old computer.  Purchased on Thanksgiving 2014.  i5 processor, 1 TB storage, 8 GB memory, HD touch screen, with Windows 10 installed.  This is a really great computer and loved it but unfortunately, I began to travel a ton for my job and it wasn't portable to work on an airplane.  But great at the hotel and great at home.  Can use as a desktop computer, semi lap top computer, and or tablet.  Comes with all of the accessories you will need.  What will you get:    -Computer - With Original Box and Paperwork and has two physical orientations with the rear folding legs besides laying flat on a flat surface.  Screen with also auto orientate in all four directions and can be locked in single direction as well    -BT Wireless Keyboard - Is missing the period and comma keys but still functional including those two buttons    -BT Wireless Mouse - Like Keyboard, already linked with the Computer    -Computer Stand - Charges the computer while in the Stand and has adjustable viewing angle    -2 Soft Tip Pen/Stylus for the Touch Screen    -3 Chargers, one for the Stand, one for around the house, and one for the road/travel    -Soft Sleeve for protection - hard to find one that is large enough to fit this unit but this one is perfect    -Back Pack / Briefcase - great bag that again was hard to find in order to be able to fit this size unit, and I put the sleeve above into the padded part of the briefcase for extra protection and worked great.  Bag also has large other pocket and smaller outer pocket.    Not looking to sell just the computer but the whole package.  Trust me when I say that you will need all of the above to get the most out of this unit.  Total cost of all of these items combined within the last year is approximately $2000.  This computer was well taken care of, minus the missing two keyboard keys.  All items in good condition.  Hope the pictures help and that you are interested and look forward to hearing from you.

         Reluctantly need to sell my MacBook Pro since the laptop is a powerhouse and has served me well, but I do have a desktop now and I suppose this baby will serve someone else too as it has done me.     This baby is in immaculate condition as I took very good care of it and was only used for personal use and not for work.    I used it primarily for graphics and video editing and it was customized to do just that when I purchased it new at $2,400 but lucky for you, I am selling it today at $1,000 cash because I need the money, hence the reluctantly part. But I could change my mind and just keep it.    Anyways, please only contact me if you are truly interested. This is a great buy, I will take no less than what I am asking. Thank you!

I can leave Lightroom &amp; Photoshop as well as Microsoft Word on there if you would like. If not I can clear the drive and you can start afresh!

         The MacBook Air features fourth-generation Intel Core processors with stunning graphics, ultrafast flash storage, great built-in apps, and all-day battery life.* It's thin, light, and durable enough to take everywhere you go???and powerful enough to do everything once you get there.    The MacBook Air with 13.3-inch screen gives you up to 12 hours of battery life ().    This 13.3-inch model of the MacBook Air (MD761LL/B) sports up to 12 hours of battery life, a 1.4 GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor (with a Turbo Boost of up to 2.7 GHz), 256 GB of flash memory storage, and 4 GB of RAM (see full specifications below). It also includes both a high-speed Thunderbolt port and two USB 3 ports, enabling you to easily connect to external displays and a wide variety of high performance peripherals.    The MacBook Air is powered by OS X Mavericks, the world's most advanced operating system and built to bring out the best in your Mac. And the MacBook Air comes pre-loaded with the latest version of the iLife software suite (iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand) as well as the iWork productivity suite (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote).    Up to 12 Hours of Battery Life    Power through your whole work day with the 13-inch MacBook Air, which delivers up to 12 hours of battery life???more time power for word processing, presentations, email, and more. The increase is due to a larger battery (thanks to the compact all-flash storage in the MacBook Air) and the new power-efficient Intel Core processor architecture. Put the MacBook Air to sleep for more than 3 hours, and it enters standby mode to conserve battery life for up to 30 days.    The MacBook Air???available in 11.6-inch and 13-inch models ().    802.11ac: The New Definition of Fast    The MacBook Air supports ultrafast 802.11ac Wi-Fi. When connected to an 802.11ac base station???including the new AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule???wireless performance is up to three times faster than with the previous generation of MacBook Air. And your Wi-Fi range improves as well.    Flash Memory Storage    By replacing the standard spinning hard drive typically found in laptops (as well as desktop PCs) with flash memory, the MacBook Air delivers an almost instantaneous boot-up when you open the display, as well as faster application launches and snappier overall performance. Additionally, Apple has shed the enclosure that typically surrounds flash memory (usually about the same size as a standard hard drive), thus giving it a smaller footprint and helping to decrease the size of the MacBook Air.    Fourth-Generation Intel Core i5 Dual-Core Processing    The ultra-efficient architecture of the fourth-generation Intel Core i5 processor was designed to use less power and still deliver high performance. It has a 1.4 GHz speed, which can dynamically accelerate up to 2.7 GHz to match your workload thanks to updated Intel Turbo Boost Technology.    And with the Intel HD Graphics 5000 processor, you get up to 40 percent faster graphics???performance you'll especially notice with games and other graphics-intensive tasks.    See .    Thunderbolt and USB 3    Delivering an amazing 10 gigabits per second of transfer speeds in both directions, the ultrafast and ultraflexible Thunderbolt port allows you to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800. You can also daisy-chain up to six Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals without using a hub. Thunderbolt also supports DisplayPort for high resolution displays and works with existing adapters for HDMI, DVI, and VGA displays.    The MacBook Air also comes with two USB 3 ports, enabling you to connect your external hard drive and transfer large files in seconds instead of minutes with speeds up to 10 times faster than USB 2. And you can connect all your USB-compatible devices, including your iPhone, iPad, iPod, or digital camera.    Integrated HD FaceTime Webcam    You'll be able to easily connect with friends, family, and business colleagues using the MacBook Air's HD 720p FaceTime camera, which is integrated into the thin bezel above the display and features three times the resolution of the previous FaceTime camera. And with Apple's FaceTime application, you're not limited to video chats with other Macs???you can now make video calls to iPhone and iPod touch users.

         This is a fully working Hackintosh / Customac that I built from a TonyMac golden build for an mATX case. I used this as my work station for a little bit, but I found myself in need of something more portable, so Macbook it is.     This computer really is an absolute beast. I just wiped it an installed the latest version of Yosemite (10.10.5) so it's all ready to go. It's been slightly overclocked to a stable 4.1 GHz which I found to be very reliable.    I used this as a graphic design platform, but it's perfect for video editing /3D rendering, CAD, music production, or gaming. This will be a super fast computer for years to come. It has OS X installed right now, but you could easily install and run Windows, or even dual boot.    Please contact me if you have any questions. I will not ship this; local pickup only please in the Southern California area (I live in Long Beach).     ALSO PLEASE NOTE that this is a Hackintosh.

         I'm selling my mini gaming PC as I have no use for it right now. Please note: the photos show a GTX 970 but it does NOT come with a graphics card. This system is designed to allow you to pick your own graphics card to suit your personal needs. I only included the GTX 970 in the pictures to show you what the system would look like when complete.    The i7-4790k has been benchmarked in order to test system stability so all you have to do is drop your own graphics card into place and you will be ready for any next gen games with great frame rates. There are even white LED's to show off the inside. This also comes with Windows 8.1 so that you can upgrade to Windows 10 for free!    I build custom gaming PCs for friends and family who want killer gaming rigs but don't have the desire or time to build them. I have a passion for building and ensure clean cable management to maximize airflow. Please check out my pcparpicker account for my build log in order to verify my experience.    Here is a website to the individual parts and pricing so you know that you are getting a good deal:    http://pcpartpicker.com/p/WnnxvK    Please contact me with any questions.  Thanks

         This Mac mini is in BRAND NEW condition, it has a fantastically fast SSD (PCIe for my fellow geeks!) and it comes with 1TB of storage. It's the highest-end model w/ 8GB of RAM.    A word about memory: Most people think they need 16GB or even more. I thought so, too, but as an IT pro, I simply realized that with everything that I do (100 tabs open simultaneously, Mail w/ 20,000+ msgs. and 7 accts., a 1080p movie playing to an externally-connected projector, all kinds of other apps open, and again, for my fellow IT guys, I even use a RAM disk for some insane Safari caching to achieve near-instantaneous browsing.    The only reason I'm having to sell it is because I need portability again, so I'm switching to a MacBook Pro. It comes with ALL original packaging, everything's in NEW condition, and I can even bundle a 512GB USB 3 external SSD, should you need one, for an add'l $180!!!    Please text me at   show contact info or simply respond to this ad to register your interest.    I'm an experienced CL seller and hope to receive serious inquiries, i.e. NO Paypal, NO shipping, local pick-up only!    Thanks for taking the time to read my ad. Have an excellent day!

         I have a 15" MacBook Pro (mid-2010) for sale. I've upgraded the memory to the maximum allowed and also upgraded the hard drive to a solid state drive.     I believe this was the last 15" MBP that had a matte screen option. I used it for my freelance photography business so it was perfect for photoshopping on location.    This one also includes a superdrive.    It's been very well taken care of. Never dropped and nothing has ever been spilled on it. There are just a few minor normal wear scratches. Not really noticeable.    I've cleared and reinstalled the OS X Yosemite so it would feel like receiving a new computer.    SPECS:  OS X Yosemite (10.10.4)  2.4 GHz Intel Core i5  480 GB Solid State SATA Drive  8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3  Intel HD Graphics 288 MB  SuperDrive    I'm selling this for $850 obo.     Feel free to contact me with any questions. I'd be happy to answer them!    Thanks for looking!

         Hi,    I am selling my Mac Pro Tower, in excellent cosmetic condition, and two IPS LCD monitors is good condition.  This tower is model version 3,1 (early 2008) so it does currently run latest OS Yosemite.  Can upgrade to El Capitan when released.  Specs are as follows:    2 X 2.8 GHz Quad Core Intel Xeon processors (8 Core Total)  22 GB 800 MHz DDR2 FB-DIMM RAM  NVIDIA GeForce 630 2048 MB (2 gigs of cache!)   Bay 1 - OWC Mercury Electra 3G SSD (solid state) 240 GB (this is for booting apps and OS)  Bay 2 - OWC Mercury Electra 3G SSD (solid state) 240 GB (can be used as a scratch disk for caching files from apps like FCP or Photoshop - makes them operate faster - or a second boot drive for Windows operating system)  Bay 3 - 1 TB SATA hard drive    Included are 2 "23 View Sonic VP2365WB monitors, 1920 X 1080 @ 60 Hz resolution, 32 Bit Color, in-plane switching (IPS) technology, LCD - excellent for video and photo color accurate editing.

I have a black and grey textured wallpaper background that does not photograph well :)    This machine runs very well, very fast, with two SSDs and 22 GB of RAM, dual monitor set up; you can handle high volume photo and video editing.

I am a professional photographer/videographer and have used this very set up to edit high end editorial and commercial photoshoots for print as well as HD video for major lifestyle brands.

Or, if you just want a fast machine with a lot of screen real estate, or a second machine for your office, this will more then suffice, as well.    The machine will come reset to factory settings with no password, new drives. I'm asking $900 cash and carry.  Brand new keyboard and mouse included, all necessary cables are also included.

I originally purchased this laptop to bring around school, but found it more convenient to use my iPad. That being said, I did not use this Macbook Pro very much and it is in excellent condition.

         I have an awesome macbook, late 2009 that I have really souped up. It has a 500GB Solid State Hard drive (Mercury OWC), 8GB of Ram, Newest operating system, New Screen, New Keyboard. It starts up in under 10 seconds, opens programs incredibly quick (you can have 15 tabs open in Chrome, start up Photoshop in 5 seconds and be playing a video game at the same time, doesn't slow down).     It technically has 1 Terabyte of space because there's an additional hard drive inside of it in the optical bay (500GB).     This is a great computer, I use it everyday. The only reason I'm selling it is because I was given a Macbook Retina.     If you're interested let me know, I'm asking $800     Thanks

         I bought this in 2006 brand new. Near top of the line in the day but still regarded as one of the best. It has always been serviced and runs about $100/2 yrs for servicing/cleaning. Never any problems. Most computer guys know how to set up the networking, use it and I will give you the servicing guys info too. It is black and white only, 3 trays,and can do 11 x 17. Guessing on size...about 3' wide x 4' high and weighs about 100lbs but it has rollers. I used it in an insurance office so scanning or printing an insurance policy happens very fast and was then saved as a pdf. I couldn't have functioned without it. It would be great for real estate, property managers, loans, cpa, etc. or any office with 2 or more employees. There are many capabilities of the machine and I only used a few. I have all the manuals and cd's for it and it runs just like brand new. By the looks of it, you would never know it was even used. It was networked with about 15 employees and I probably changed ink barely annually. I believe ink about $100 so not much more than normal ink and lasts a long time. If I had an office I would keep it in a heartbeat. I believe it was about $10k new so this is a great price and will really help your business. Price is fair but i am negotiable as I do want to sell it. If interested I could deliver it too. Matt

         Selling a great gaming laptop for $800 (no low ball offers please). I'm moving and buying a cheaper, light-duty laptop as a replacement. No more gaming on the go :(    This thing is packed with powerful components... It has:    i7 CPU  GTX 770!  16 GB of DDR3 RAM  750GB Hard Disk (Used for storing documents/pictures/movies etc.) AND a 256GB Solid State Drive (SSD is used for the games and the operating system so everything opens basically instantly) that I installed aftermarket...  17" screen with 1920x1080  KillerLAN WiFi and Bluetooth  LED Backlit keyboard  USB 3.0 + USB 2.0  Windows 10 freshly installed for you!    This thing is a gaming beast. It can run all the new titles, and you'll be way over 60FPS on most games. That's pretty amazing for a laptop. It's pretty heavy, which is a downside for some, but I am fine with it (It's 9.5 pounds!).

         We won this computer in a drawing, but are struggling to pay the bills, so really could use the money more than the item.

You can see it is still sealed.

         Selling a 13" MacBook Pro, mid-2011 model. Laptop is in excellent condition - very gently used. No physical signs of wear. Have never had any problem with it - no repairs or bugs. Recently replaced the wireless internet card to ensure faster/better connection. Has all updated software installed - did a clean reset so that the buyer can set it up as their own new machine.     Have original box, power cord, software disks, etc. Will also include black Marc by Marc Jacobs laptop sleeve (if you want it!). Love this laptop - only reason I'm selling is because I was just given a brand new MacBook Air for work, and it doesn't make sense to keep two laptops around anymore.     Please feel free to contact me if you'd like additional specs on the laptop. Thanks!

         BRAND NEW - SEALED - STILL IN BROWN SHIPPING BOX.   BOUGHT FROM AN APPLE AUTHORIZED DEALER IN AUGUST 2015.   I WILL GIVE YOU THE RECEIPT SO YOU CAN REGISTER AND GET FULL APPLE WARRANTY ON IT.    TEXT ONLY   show contact info     APPLE MACBOOK AIR i5 MJVM2LL/A 11.6-INCH LAPTOP (128 GB) NEWEST VERSION    - NEWEST VERSION - 2015 MODEL  - 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 (Broadwell) 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM  - 128GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000  - 11.6" LED-Backlit Glossy Display 1366 x 768 Native Resolution  - 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2  - 720p FaceTime HD Camera Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite  - 2015 Model      TEXT  31O 43O 8586 ANDY      The 11.6" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (2015 Model) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.38-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68" -- it tapers down to 0.11" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 128GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 9 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 11.6" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1366 x 768. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the "netbook" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics.
